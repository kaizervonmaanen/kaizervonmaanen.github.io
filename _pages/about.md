    <H3>⅃</H3> <p> (b. 1984, Norway) lives and works in Oslo, Norway. He has a very recognisable style and works in oil paint, acrylics, drawing, multiple forms of printmaking and digital art. ⅃ works in a conceptual tradition where the artwork are the result of play-acting sessions as the emperor of the moon. He gives surreal descriptions (with words and images) of an imagined world on the moon's far side to ever-changing self-made software that results in a sketch finished by hand. He explores the relationship between the artist's role, the physical work, the human behind it and the power dynamics between ourselves and our technology.</p>

    <H3>⅃</H3> <p> dedicates himself to exploring the three-way relationship between the human condition, the natural world and our technology. His previous projects include <em>The Robot Project</em> where he created a robot that could draw and alternatively told the robot what to draw and made it draw while also the robot told him what to draw back.</p>

    <H3>⅃</H3><p>'s works are deeply abstract, with hints of something figurative, which provides each piece with a hazy, dreamlike quality. He wants to change how abstract art is viewed and intends to influence a change towards a more baroque and extravagant aesthetic. He feels maximalism better reflects our human condition in the age of the internet. He strives to make the most beautiful work possible with intentionality, personal style and skill to promote the lush and baroque aesthetic he would want to surround himself with. <b>Too much of a good thing is fantastic!</b></p>
