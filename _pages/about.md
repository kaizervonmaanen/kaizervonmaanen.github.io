     <p>I believe I am on earth to make art that hopefully will make people confident that machines cannot take over in the coming age of automation. I am worried about it so I explore it. I am constantly creating software and hardware and including them in my artistic process as much as possible, see how much I can let it take over before I lose grasp of it. I once was called a quisling when I explained how I work. I believe that good art has a recognisable and unique style with a human touch. I have such a style; nobody makes anything similar to what I do. So my signature is subtle; it is barely more than a line and often hidden.<H3 style="color: #CCCCCC;">â…ƒ</H3>I don't need anything more. My style is distinct.
        <br><br>
     My art is baroque and lush. It is tactile with impasto and fingerprints from my hand on the paper and canvas with pencil, charcoal, and paints. Despite how much technology is involved, it is profoundly human and done with passion. My art is a jungle and majesty, and not just me. It is everything we don't want to lose as we can glimpse a ruined world on the horizon. Too much of a good thing is fantastic; that is my aesthetic. I will let the brushes swing and the pencil glide, and God decides if anyone will like it.</p>
