    <H3>⅃</H3><p> (b. 1984, Norway) decided to be an artist at 7 when his classmates were impressed by his drawing skills, and he liked the attention. Today he draws, paints and makes prints in various materials and techniques. Art also became a means for him to find a cultural identity and place in the world while being a half-Brazilian and half-Norwegian Muslim. Living in a multi-cultural world means showing and hiding different parts of oneself in different situations. So a significant amount of his work is a poetic exploration of identity as performance and concept.<br><br>
    Educated as an engineer, he also has included self-made technology deeply into his process to shave away the person from a lot of the creative process. And only retain the human touch as the labour involved in making the artwork. For example, putting pencil on paper, paint on canvas, et cetera. It explores the role of technology in art, its relationship to identity, and the artist's role as a producer of culture. He also does this to stylise and emphasise what influences artwork and the role influence has in the creative process. It is also fun that he works traditionally using a model or reference and painting it based on how it looks. Although due to technology, we are in a situation where we can use an artistic process exclusively used by figurative painters to paint something abstract.<br><br>
    He also experimented with creating robots that drew and painted, but it lacked the distinct and unique style he developed over many years which he wanted to keep. Beauty is essential in ⅃'s work, it is supposed to nurish the heart and not only the brain.</p>
