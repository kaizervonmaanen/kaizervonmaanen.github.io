    <H3>⅃</H3><p>(b. 1984, Norway) is a brazilian-norwegian. Decided to be an artist at the age of 7, is owned by collectors in Norway and in the UK. Has two murals in Glasgow, Scotland. Thought deep knowledge about a common artistic subject would be more useful to the art than art school so he studied environmental science. Art also became a means for him to find a cultural connection and identity while being a half-brazilian and half-norwegian muslim that has changed his name several times.</p>
